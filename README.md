# My .emacs File (Call it YilMAX config)

Pretty Much self explanatory config it contains the bare minimum in the init.el file and tries to contain all its configuration in the myinit.org file. Then it is loaded by org-bable.

# It Uses
  + ivy as a completion framework
  + telephone line with a customization for both emacsclient and emacs as a powerline
  + neotree for side tab file manager
  + hydra
  + projectile
  + the Hyper key for expanding the emacs key config
  + eshell with ivy tab completion
  + etc ...

# How it Looks
