# My .emacs File

Pretty Much self explanatory config it contains the bare minimum in the init.el file and tries to contain all its configuration in the myinit.org file. Then it is loaded by org-bable.

# It Uses
  + ivy as a completion framework
  + telephone line with a customization for both emacsclient and emacs as a powerline
  + neotree for side tab file manager
  + hydra
  + projectile
  + the Hyper key for expanding the emacs key config (my .Xmodmap is included in this repository and  shows the keyboard mapping changes  I applied.)
  + eshell with ivy tab completion
  + etc ...
